[Bluetooth surround sound](btsurround/)
----
I wanted a quick and portable way to deploy positional audio into a space. This project explores using Bluetooth speakers and PulseAudio to accomplish this.

[ESP8266](esp8266/)
----
The ESP8266 is a very cool little WIFI enabled uC and the market is flooded with cheap modules that have been built around it. I am looking at various solutions that can be built around it to make renter friendly smart home devices.

[bampy](https://github.com/innovate-invent/bampy)
----
Most python libraries that allow reading and writing HTS data (sam/bam) either link against HTSLib externally or are limited in functionality. I needed a python native implementation of HTSLib to allow compatibility with the Numba project. This will allow for much faster performing python code and even GPU accelerated algorithms.

[configutator](https://github.com/innovate-invent/configutator)
----
I was not satisfied with the command line argument parsers available for python and wrote my own. It was built to minimise the amount of code needed while maximising flexibility. This is intended for applications where the command line arguments are numerous. 

blind winder (Pending)
----
Ever see those blinds that automatically go up and down in smart homes? Well I needed a more renter friendly solution. There are some good ones on the market but they are over $100 per window. I know I can build it cheaper.
