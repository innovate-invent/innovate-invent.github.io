Recently I found myself copy pasting a significant amount of boilerplate code for a number of projects.
This prompted me to create a [template GitHub repository](https://github.com/innovate-invent/spa_template) to allow 
faster creation of new projects.

This repository differs from the code generated by the `vue init` cli command by a number of aspects. 
* Includes some files specifically for building and hosting the app on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Template home page layout with news and navigation
* [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) boilerplate including dynamic loading of static content
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) Material Design Component Framework
* [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) basic test for the navigation Vue
* TypeScript descriptors for various modules
* A global SCSS file
* Custom configuration for Prettier, Vue, and TypeScript
* Custom index.html file with various improvements

See the [repository readme](https://github.com/innovate-invent/spa_template) for more information
