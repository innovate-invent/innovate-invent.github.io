URL friendly data encoding is important when working with data URIs and APIs that work with binary formatted data.
base64url is a modification of the base64 encoding that replaces the problematic characters of base64 for URLs. This
means swapping '+' for '-' and '/' for '_', as well as removing the trailing '===' padding.

I found myself needing a concise and dependency free base64url encode/decoder that leverages the native base64 encoding
functions. The following is a mix of my own design and elements from numerous alternative solutions from across the
internet. There are a number of libraries published to NPM that accomplish this but sometimes adding a dependency adds
complexity and [risk](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/rage-quit-coder-unpublished-17-lines-of-javascript-and-broke-the-internet/).

```typescript
function base64url_encode(buffer: ArrayBuffer): string {
    return btoa(Array.from(new Uint8Array(buffer)).map(String.fromCharCode).join(''))
        .replaceAll('+', '-')
        .replaceAll('/', '_')
        .replace(/=+$/, '');
}

function base64url_decode(value: string): ArrayBuffer {
    const m = value.length % 4;
    return (new TextEncoder()).encode(atob(
        value.replaceAll('-', '+')
            .replaceAll('_', '/')
            .padEnd(value.length + (m === 0 ? 0 : 4 - m), '=')
    )).buffer
}
```

Things to note about this implementation are:

- `base64url_decode()` will return an ArrayBuffer that is **read only**. Use `buffer.slice(0)` to make a writable copy.
- The replaceAll and padEnd functions used may require polyfills if you intend to target Internet Explorer.
- `replaceAll` was chosen in place of `replace(regex,)` as it should be faster than the overhead of the regex engine.
- The `map().join()` pattern is an optimisation that avoids resizing a string for every byte.
