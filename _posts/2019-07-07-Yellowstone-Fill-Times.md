Yellowstone National Park was the worlds first national park. It spans three states and is home to amazing geographic features, wildlife, Yellowstone Lake, and of course the geysers. It is a popular destination for tourists from around the world and accommodation is competitive. If you haven't booked a year in advance you will be surprised by the unusually high hotel pricing when you arrive. 

If you are making last minute plans, there are still some cheap options. The park has first come-first serve campgrounds that you might be able to stay in. The campgrounds, lodges, and hotels are hosted either by the [National Parks Service (NPS)](https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm), or a private management company: [Xanterra Travel Collection](https://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/). Searching the internet for reliable information can be difficult as this private company is not forth coming about its distinction from the parks services. Calling their service desk and asking for information can also yield very misleading information, it became clear when talking to them that they avoid answering questions that could direct you to the NPSs services. Even on the NPS website it does not make it clear that certain accommodations are privately managed and at best refer to them as ['concession operated'](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/parkfacts.htm#CP___PAGEID%3D2632122%2C%2Fyell%2Fplanyourvisit%2Fcampgrounds.htm%2C10747%7C) in the facts page.

Here is a map of the park with the campsites and some interesting locations marked:

Campgrounds managed by Xanterra are marked in green: Bridge Bay, Canyon, Fishing Bridge RV Park, Grant Village, and Madison.

Campgrounds belonging to the NPS are marked brown: Indian Creek, Lewis Lake, Mammoth, Norris, Pebble Creek, Slough Creek, and Tower Fall.

Two additional campgrounds were marked outside the park that might be worth looking at. Lewis & Clark Caverns State Park has reservable cabins and campsites that do not fill until much later in the year. Eagle Creek Campground is another option but its close proximity to the park will likely have it fill quickly too.

Xanterras campgrounds are reservable and usually book up a year in advance. It is still possible to get into these campsites the day of, if there is a last minute cancellation or someone leaves early. This is not the case for the NPS campgrounds, they are available to the first person to get there the morning you wish to stay and you can keep the campsite for 14 days (during the summer season). If you call the NPS information center they will not provide you with any information on how busy the campsites usually are and advise you to arrive early to wait in line (5-6am). You can not stay in the park outside of designated camp sites, and for someone travelling a great distance to visit this poses a risk of being stranded outside the park in the middle of the night. The decision to take a gamble on the availability of the NPS campsites should not be taken lightly and thoruough research should be done to ensure an enjoyable vacation.

Luckily the NPS provides the time a campsite fills each day on their [website](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm). Plotting this data can reveal trends that would aide the decision to visit the park.
