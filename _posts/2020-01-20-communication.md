>Let’s suppose I love some girl, rapturously, and somebody says to me, "Do you really love her?" Well, 
>how am I going to prove this? 
>
>They say, "Write poetry. Tell us all how much you love her. Then we’ll believe you." 
>So if I’m an artist, and I can put this into words and convince everybody that I’ve written the most ecstatic love

>But supposing you’re not very articulate?
