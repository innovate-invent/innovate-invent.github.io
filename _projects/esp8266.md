The ESP8266 is a great little WIFI module that can run micropython.

From the homepage of the [vendor](https://espressif.com/en/products/esp8266/):

> ESP8266 is a highly integrated chip designed for the needs of a new connected world. It offers a complete and self-contained WiFi networking solution, allowing it to either host the application or to offload all WiFi networking functions from another application processor.

Condensed specs:

* WiFi (802.11 b/g/n, direct connect and AP mode, WEP, WPA/WPA2)
* integrated TCP/IP protocol stack
* uProcessor (Xtensa LX106) @ 80Mhz, 96kB data RAM, 64kB instruction RAM
* SDIO 1.1/2.0, SPI, UART, GPIO
* Vcc 3.3V, I = 0.5uA..215mA
* application interface uses AT commands

# Getting Started

Docker is a tool that provides a container that houses all the tools necessary to build micropython. It automates setting up the build environment and isolates it from your main system.

1. Install Docker and git
```sh
sudo apt-get install docker git
```
2. Build ESP docker image  
```sh
docker build https://github.com/nevers/esp-open-sdk-docker.git
```

# Building micropython

There are pre-built micropython binaries for a variety of microprocessors available online. These next steps are if you want to make modifications to the micropython codebase.

1. Clone the micropython repo and make any modifications  
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:micropython/micropython.git
```

2. Build micropython  
```sh
docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd`/micropython/ports/esp8266/ esp-open-sdk:2.0.0 make axtls
docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd`/micropython/ports/esp8266/ esp-open-sdk:2.0.0 make
```
  
# Checking connectivity

1. Plug in your programmer/serial device to your computer and ESP and find the tty name:
  ```sh
  dmesg | tail
  ```

  The output should look something like this:
  ```sh
  usb 5-2: New USB device found, idVendor=0403, idProduct=6010
  usb 5-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
  usb 5-2: Product: DLP2232M
  usb 5-2: Manufacturer: FTDI
  usb 5-2: SerialNumber: FTYRWJML
  usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial_generic
  usbserial: USB Serial support registered for generic
  usbcore: registered new interface driver ftdi_sio
  usbserial: USB Serial support registered for FTDI USB Serial Device
  ftdi_sio 5-2:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
  usb 5-2: Detected FT2232C
  usb 5-2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
  ftdi_sio 5-2:1.1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
  ```

2. Check for connectivity by changing `/dev/ttyUSB0` to the correct tty device and run the command
```sh
docker run --rm -ti --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd`/micropython/ports/esp8266/ -e PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 esp-open-sdk:2.0.0 python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

3. Reset the ESP and you should see the bootloader output to your terminal, otherwise see [esptool troubleshooting tips](https://github.com/espressif/esptool#troubleshooting) for more information.

4. Press `CTRL+]` to exit.  


# Flashing the compiled binary

1. Reset the ESP while holding GPIO0 low, this will put it into flash mode.

2. Change `/dev/ttyUSB0 ` in the command below with the correct tty device and run to flash to that device
```sh
docker run --rm -ti --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd`/micropython/ports/esp8266/ esp-open-sdk:2.0.0 make PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 deploy
```

3. Reset the ESP

# Initial setup

1. Micropython has the WebREPL disabled by default so you will need to configure it. Connect to the serial REPL using the following command
```sh
docker run --rm -ti --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd`/micropython/ports/esp8266/ -e PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 esp-open-sdk:2.0.0 python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

2. Press `CTRL-B` to get the prompt, it should appear as `>>>`. Test the prompt by typing `print('hello esp8266!')`.

3. Connect the ESP to your wifi by running the following commands ([See here for details](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/network_basics.html#configuration-of-the-wifi))
```python
import network
sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta_if.active(True)
sta_if.connect('<your ESSID>', '<your password>')
sta_if.ifconfig()
```

4. Confugure WebREPL by typing `import webrepl_setup` and follow the prompts.

5. Press `CTRL-D` to restart the ESP. Browse to [MicroPython browser WebREPL](https://micropython.org/webrepl/) and connect to the ESPs IP address to access the WebREPL.
