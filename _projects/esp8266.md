The ESP8266 is a great little WIFI module that can run micropython.

From the homepage of the [vendor](https://espressif.com/en/products/esp8266/):

> ESP8266 is a highly integrated chip designed for the needs of a new connected world. It offers a complete and self-contained WiFi networking solution, allowing it to either host the application or to offload all WiFi networking functions from another application processor.

Condensed specs:

* WiFi (802.11 b/g/n, direct connect and AP mode, WEP, WPA/WPA2)
* integrated TCP/IP protocol stack
* uProcessor (Xtensa LX106) @ 80Mhz, 96kB data RAM, 64kB instruction RAM
* SDIO 1.1/2.0, SPI, UART, GPIO
* Vcc 3.3V, I = 0.5uA..215mA
* application interface uses AT commands

# Getting Started

Docker is a tool that provides a container that houses all the tools necessary to build micropython. It automates setting up the build environment and isolates it from your main system.

1. Install Docker  
  `sudo apt-get install docker`
2. Build ESP docker image  
  `sudo docker build https://github.com/nevers/esp-open-sdk-docker.git`

# Building micropython

There are pre-built micropython binaries for a variety of microprocessors available online. These next steps are if you want to make modifications to the micropython codebase.
1. Make sure you have git  
  `sudo apt-get install git`
2. Clone the micropython repo and make any modifications  
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:micropython/micropython.git  
  cd micropython
  ```
3. Build micropython  
  ```sudo docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` esp-open-sdk-docker make```
